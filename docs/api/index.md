# API Reference

Welcome to the **Here** library API Reference!

The library provides mainly functional types that are the very root structures to simplify treatments and help to improve the semantic of some code.

Main entry points of the library are the [Option<T>](Here.Option-1.yml), the [Either<TLeft, TRight>](Here.Either-2.yml), Results ([Result](Here.Result.yml), [Result<T>](Here.Result-1.yml), [CustomResult<TError>](Here.CustomResult-1.yml) and [Result<T, TError>](Here.Result-2.yml)) structs and the the [ValueObject](Here.ValueObject.yml) class.
