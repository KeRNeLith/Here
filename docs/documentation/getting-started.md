# Getting started

The library is pretty simple to use, it provides some useful and convenient types including following ones:

- [`Option<T>`](tutorials/option.md): This structure encapsulates the concept of having a value or not.

- [`Either<TLeft, TRight>`](tutorials/either.md): This structure encapsulates the concept of having a success value (right) or a failure (left).

- [`Result`](tutorials/results.md): This structure encapsulates treatments results.

- [`ValueObject`](tutorials/value-object.md): This structure encapsulates boilerplate code required to compare objects on their values rather than their references.
