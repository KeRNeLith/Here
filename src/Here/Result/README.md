# Result

The `Result` is a structure that encapsulates treatments results. 
It provide an enhanced return state for methods that improve the code semantic and allow to react based on this state.
This can be useful when trying to implement a clear and simple error handling.
What you just have to do to use it is to put a using like this for basic implementation:

```csharp
using Here.Results;
```

And this one for extensions:

```csharp
using Here.Results.Extensions;
```

## Why Result?

Because it offers a better handling of methods returns. It can be a nice alternative to traditional booleans or return code.
